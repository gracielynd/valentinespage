          <h4>
            This year, dating has run into problems due to COVID-19. A lot of fancy/special restaurants may be closed because of this. If this does happen to be a problem for your evening date, (or you're looking for a cheeper option), these are some options to consider:

          <h4>Create Your Own Dance Party</h4>
          <p>
            Doesn't matter what music you listen to, but you can take dance lessons on YouTube. Learn the waltz and dance to your favorite slow songs, for example. There are plenty of dances that can be learned, and YouTube is a great source for that. Even if you don't want slow songs, you can have your own dance-off to some of your favorites!

          <h4>Have a Cook-Off</h4>
          <p>
            Sometimes, it's more fun to be at home for dinner, and a lot more meaningful. Why not make it fun? You can each create a dish, then fill out score cards to determine who has more skill (and who might have to be the one to cook between the two of you).

          <h4>Recreate Your First Date</h4>
          <p>
            Recreating a first date can be a lot of fun! Taking a trip down memory lane as a Valentine's Day date. It can also show how much you remember about the early days of your relationship, and why you're together. If it's all closed, be creative about recreating the date at your own home for a fun twist!
